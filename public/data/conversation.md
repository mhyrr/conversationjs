# The Outrage Theory of Opinion

### Luddites and Progress [collapsed=false]
- @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: I didn't know she was a Luddite, but I also am so disconnected from news that I've never been suggested anything by or about her. My detector said she was just another well-intentioned but naive do gooder to be ignored. Your description is consistent with my uninformed impression ü§£

Should I have been paying attention? Has she really had negative impact on making the world more sustainable, beautiful, and plentiful?

As for outrage theory, I always come back to panem et circem. And in this case, the circem are played in media with our current avatars Trump and Harris (though take your pick from the many other games depending on if your interest is F1, NFL, or parsing theory). If we didn't have these games, we'd simply have other ones. And with the massive splintering of attention due to the embarrassment of niche riches that is modern social media, outrage bleeds, so it leads. It's a train wreck. Look away!

  - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: It may be naive - I'm unconvinced of that although it may be - but naivete in this case is still insidiously bad. Because of this: "her story about the future of the world is negative, uninspiring, and ugly. I want to tell a story about a sustainable, beautiful and plentiful future too. But mine has more people, more technology and is generally optimistic rather than performatively pessimistic"
 
  The stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and our future are important. The more aspirational the better. The degrowth-ers are doing the world a great disservice. I accept it as a dampening effect to the e/acc crowd but I do not think it should be the primary philosophy.

### Modern Disconnection [collapsed=false]
- @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: I don't disagree that things in general now are better than they were, but it's not a universal good. I think we are in a quantifiable sense more connected with each other now, but in a spiritual sense, more disconnected from each other as well. I think the ability and opportunity to hoard wealth has grown exponentially since the dawn of the agrarian age which only accelerated with the industrial and information ages. You talk of flattening, but in a visceral sense, I live in a totally different world than some of the people (especially when I shop at Walmart ü§£). And as far away from them as I am, there are others that much farther away from me. While we all have to satisfy the 3-4 Fs, but if we were all to gather in a room our private lives would inconceivable to each other, and that's the sense of "better in the past" I suspect people long for.

  - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: Yeah there‚Äôs this idea that some places are living in the future. Obvious examples of this are places like SF or Silicon Valley, Austin, etc. Similarly, when I drive through some places - Denton MD comes to mind - I feel like it‚Äôs a town that‚Äôs literally still stuck in 1995 or earlier.  I‚Äôve long wanted to build a map based on how ‚Äúin the future‚Äù or ‚Äúin the past‚Äù an area is. A lot of Maryland and DC is going to be quite high on that topology and I bet a lot of OK is in a different part (never been there). You could probably proxy this with things like home value per sq. ft and similar metrics. This is for sure simply related to wealth although it‚Äôs probably not exact.

  One hypothesis I have about this is that the most dynamic and interesting places to live are actually where there‚Äôs a very high gradient between places in the past and places in the future. The beach feels like this to me, where there‚Äôs an affluent, very forward looking population and then a steep drop off as you drive just a few miles inland. It makes the whole area much more interesting.

  But yes I agree that we‚Äôre literally living in a different world.  Part of that is internal - we have different models and abstractions of the world.  Most of it is material. But the floor is different, which is the point of PG‚Äôs quip, and Ridley‚Äôs story.
  A lot of the rosy retrospection bias is about cultural and internal beliefs than it is material goods. When people imagine the perfect Sandlot-esque picture of the 1950s, they‚Äôre focused on the perspective and cultures of the people in that time, not the technology.  They imagine a world where neighbors talk to each other, share earnestness, where kids can play safely (or perceived as such) and there are community ties that link us all together in both feast and famine.

  And we can have those things today. But our systems and environments and our own incentives and cultures have largely eradicated them.


- @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: The phrase "we're all in this together" is the hollow platitude these Luddites who romantically long for the past wish weren't so untrue.

Why do you think you and I are better friends than with other potential pairings even within our peer groups? I have a few very good friends, and for the most part don't try to gather them together as the only unifying thread between them all is that I like their thought processes. But their political, philosophical, and personal views are so wildly different and opposed, I certainly wouldn't want to be the reason they happen to all meet each other!

  - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: I have this same question... I was nervous to do a bit of that unification at the crab feast, for instance! But it was good - and you made an impact on some others there.. The teenagers in particular were immediately like ‚Äúthis dude is cool‚Äù.

  Why is that? Two reasons I can think of..

  The first is earnestness. Whether there‚Äôs agreement or disagreement, bias or not, a common thread with all of my closest friends is that they are all honestly engaged with the other.

  The second is excitement, or maybe curiosity. When people get to know me I think they see that I‚Äôm still genuinely interested and curious about a lot. This is also true with you. We have not done a slip-slide into status quo or mechanical thinking. Our brains are still plastic :) 

  I use how teenagers react to me as a gauge for this - their spidey sense is often particularly well-refined to pickup on bullshit, faux authority, and static thinking and so they react very positively to adults who don‚Äôt bullshit, don‚Äôt think they know better and keep asking questions.

- @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: You experienced a similar trepidation, though it went off relatively hitch free (we'll see how my views on technology and parenting went over assuming that specific Love brother even remembers our conversation ü§£). But I tend not to have true or strongly expressible views on subjects. Many of the people I'm friends with don't have such a liquid ideology.

  - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: :) See above

- @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: Which gets at one reason for disconnection. I'm the common thread and it's not ideology or shared senses of purpose or goals. Personally I like how wildly different all these people think and the fact that they seem not to mind that I will vociferously disagree when I see fit. But I've watched them interact with other people and I'm often afforded ideological freedom they don't grant to others. Which is why I don't try to connect them.

  - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: Who are you talking about here? The people at Walmart? Or your different friends that all think differently?

    - @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: Test

      - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: Yeah


### Strong/Weak Links, Socioeconomic Policy, Marginal Dollars, and Wealth [collapsed=false]
- @wsdoun [2024-03-20]: It should go without saying that I'm a weak linker when it comes to measuring the outcomes of socioeconomic policy. I don't care about providing social support to the top and my measure of how "good" the system works is how well the low end is doing. Homelessness and starvation should be an embarrassing problem for the US to have, but how well the system works is determined by how well the bottom does. My view is that it's not doing well.
If there's a "bell curve" for performance, it's not a gaussian bell but rather long tailed with inconceivably high performance on the high end. Poverty is also not a true bell curve, and from my condescending point of view, society's pets shouldn't be living that poorly.

  - @grolsen [2024-03-20]: Question: how do you fix these things both short term and long term? In both contexts, the measurement is weak link. But short term I‚Äôd argue the solutions are weak link and long term they‚Äôre strong link.

  Related: do you think income inequality (or net worth inequality) is a reasonable proxy measurement?
